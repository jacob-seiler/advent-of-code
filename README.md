# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to questions from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## To run a solution

1. Find the folder corresponding to the question solution you want to run.

2. Add a text file with the same name as the code file (Ex. if the code is `q17.py`, add a text file with the name `q17.txt`).

3. Go to the [advent of code website](https://adventofcode.com/), find the corresponding problem, get your unique input, and paste its contents into the text file you just created.

4. Run the code file.

## To work on a new question

1. Copy the template folder from the root into the corresponding year.

2. Rename the folder and its files to the question name (Ex. `q17/q17.py`, `q17/q17.txt`).

3. Open the code and update the part of the path that says `template.txt` to the renamed filename (Ex. `q17.txt`).
